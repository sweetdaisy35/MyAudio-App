The program compiles and runs within on the terminal without any errors
1. File I/O and exception handling works correctly
- 7 custom exception classes were created at the bottom of Library.java

2. The return type of all the boolean methods in Libray.java was changed 
to void and the errMsg variable was replaced by throwing custom exceptions.

3. The DOWNLOAD action was updated to download a range of audio content. 
Additional methods DOWNLOADA and DOWNLOADG were added and they are case 
sensitive.

4. A map was used to search for an audio content title. The title 
parameter in the searchTitle method is case sensitive.

5. Another map was used to search for an audio content with the specified 
artist/author. The artist parameter in the searchA method is case sensitive.

6. Another map was used to search for an audio content with the specified 
genre. The genre parameter in the searchG method is case sensitive.

-----------------Bonus---------------------

7. The bonus was completed by creating additional methods in Song.java and 
AudioBook.java. The target parameter in the searchP method in AudioContentStore
is case sensitive. 

Note: Although this assignment does not make use of the podcast class/methods,
I still included them within the program. The program runs as expected 
regardless. 


Thank you for your time.
